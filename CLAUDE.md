- No build system or scripts
- No test framework or tests
- No linting or formatting configuration
- No CI/CD pipelines

## Development Guidelines

### Git Workflow

- Single initial commit on the repository so far
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Push to feature branches; avoid pushing directly to main

### When Adding Code

As the project develops, update this file to reflect:

1. **Tech stack** — language, framework, runtime version requirements
2. **Setup instructions** — how to install dependencies and run the project
3. **Build & run commands** — dev server, production build, etc.
4. **Test commands** — how to run tests, what framework is used
5. **Lint & format commands** — tools and configuration
6. **Project structure** — directory layout and architecture conventions
7. **Key patterns** — naming conventions, error handling, state management, etc.
